// FIXME: remove this token
// NOTE: as long as this token is saved in the frontend, the application is not production ready.
// The Baerer token must be used on a server whose inner workings are not exposed to the outside world
// For simplicity and the sake of this tutorial, I'll just leave it here like this
// But just bear in mind: NEVER EVER save a bearer token inside the frontend code
